<h2>So who am I?</h2>
<p title="About Me">
Always wasting time on one thing or other, coz i get bored. Things come one after the other and i keep on swapping them under my own heart until my existence. I've learnt a few tricks that i use to lure people up to me and in the end its all about how you impress people.</p>

<p>A <mark>poem</mark> i live by:</p>
<pre style="color:red" > 
	I see a beautiful city....
	and a brilliant people,
	rising from this abyss.....
	I see the lives,
	for which I lay down my life - 
	peaceful, useful, prosperous and happy.....
	I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, 
	and in the hearts of their descendants,
	generations hence.....
	It is a far, far better thing that I do,
	than I have ever done; 
	it is a far, far better rest that I go to,
	than I have ever known......

</pre>
