    <h2>Movies</h2>
    <p>All the cool movies i love or want to see, i want to keep them there so i have a proper list of what i like most and what i want to be wth my rest of life. </p>

    <h2>TV Serials</h2>
    <p>I never knew that TV Serials would ever get so good that you won't even care for movies. From the Knight Rider and X-files to Game of Thrones and Sherlock, would be here. So i could think about them whenever i'm over the internet.</p>

<div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Games</h2>
    <p>The first game i ever played on my monitor screen was Lion King. So, from that till the FIFA 15, i want to think and discourse about them, so i know what i've lost in my insanity and what more  can do. The first love was PC, but now it has gone bigger than all of us and now its ruled by Playstation 3 & XBOX. So there's a lot to discuss here.</p>

<div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Softwares</h2>
    <p>The love of software originated from Windows 98 when i opened new themes from appearance from my desktop to ACDSEE to NETSCAPE and all that. And now ts all about Torrenting for all the latest cool softwares from Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, Corel and all the multi-billionaire companies.</p>

<div class="col-md-4">
    <h2>Websites</h2>
    <p>The first ever website which i got to open was <a href="http://www.yahoo.com" target="_blank">Yahoo!</a>. And from all that to Reddit, i wanna explore inside myself to look for all the bleak and awesome stuff i can gather inside it.</p>
  </div>

<div class="col-md-4">

    <h2>Apps</h2>
    <p> I reminisce all the stuff we left behind. I never wanted to grow up. I just want to go back to my childhood to see more and more of everything. Now from all that Games and Software, its been radicalized to APPS and now the name sticks for everything be it: Android or iOS. This sticks to all platforms. Welcome aboard the hovertrain.</p>
