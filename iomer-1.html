<h2>Why This</h2>
<p>
I needed a proper weblog for collecting and storing all the things i loved, liked or wanted to learn. The idea is more as taken by the thought that "What would i want to open the moment i come on internet?" The answer to me is myself, be it Facebook, Reddit or Twitter. I need a place that's just for myself and can be used as a library of me, so i know where everything is placed and where i will be soon.
</p>
<p>
So this web space over at GITHub takes me up a notch by explaining myself to the internet. Because for me Internet is the real truth amidst all chaos, its the one place i want to be alive and moving for ever.
