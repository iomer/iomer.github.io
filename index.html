<h1>Using Proper Semantics in HTML</h1>

<h2>iOmer - Html training log</h2>
 
<p>The basic sense of html is as a markup language so in layman terms we are only gonna put markup which means textual information over the markup layer of webpage.<br>
<p>

<p>Tags are
<ul>DOCTYPE</ul>
<ul>HTML</ul>
<ul>HEAD</ul>
<ul>Title</ul>
<ul>Body</ul>
All the preceding tags are ended with </> depending upon their usage.
</p>

<p>I checked out tutorials from <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3 Schools</a> because their tutorials are most sought after in entire world wide web fraternity.

<p> Why this? Because i've to understand the HTML language under industry standards, so i've to do some work log showing all my work over here at github. I got the idea of blogging and learning through <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1285016">The Social Network</a>. So i'l be moving on of this learning and will be doing HTML examples under my own blogging. Lets put hands in hand and move on.
